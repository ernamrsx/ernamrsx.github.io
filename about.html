  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, I’m Erna — a working student with a strong interest in technology,
    web development, and continuous learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I created this website as a personal space to document my academic journey,
    showcase projects, and build a growing portfolio for future professional
    opportunities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Balancing work and study has shaped me to be disciplined, adaptable,
    and consistent in learning new skills, especially in the field of
    web development and information technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website will continue to evolve as I learn, build, and grow.
